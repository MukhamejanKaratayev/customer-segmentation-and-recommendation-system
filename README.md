# customer-segmentation-and-recommendation-system

The product sales increase is one of the most
important objectives of any company, as it is the major source of
revenue. The development of modern data mining and big data
techniques has helped to reach this goal by properly analyzing
their customer data. Therefore, the startup company which sells
cosmetic products through a E-commerce web platform decided
to initiate a data mining project to encourage customers to
buy more of their products. The goal of this research is to
conduct the CRISP-DM process framework for this project. First,
the optimal clustering algorithm was found, which segments
customers into specific groups based on their behavior. Then,
the product preferences of each customer were analyzed, and
a recommendation system was proposed based on the analysis
of the purchased combinations of products. Overall, the results
demonstrate that the project justifies its cost by achieving datamining and business goals.
